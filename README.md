Please download the zip file from github and run it with a Java SE-1.8 JDK library at least. It also runs in visual studio.
My set up that I coded and ran it on was on eclipse.

Run the NumberSummarizerApp.java file to run with a default input
 or to have the option of entering your own input.
This is located in "/NumberSummarizer/src/main/java/numberrangesummarizer/NumberSummarizerApp.java"

Run the NumberSummarizerTest.java file for multiple input tests to run.
This is located in "/NumberSummarizer/src/test/java/numberrangesummarizer/NumberSummarizerTest.java"

This is located in "/NumberSummarizer/src/main/java/numberrangesummarizer/NumberRangeSummarizerImpl.java"
